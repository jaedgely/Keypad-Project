# Keypad-Project
This was a relatively simple project featuring a membrane keypad, and LCD display, and an UNO R3 Microcontroller

The KeypadProject.ino file creates an alarm sytem which takes input from a magnetic door sensor, and the keypad.

The output, aside from printing on the LCD display, is two LEDs, one signifies if the system is active, and the other if the alarm has gone off.

All inputs and outputs are variables, meaning that you can easily change which pin the UNO R3 will read/write, depending on your setup.

No known bugs!
